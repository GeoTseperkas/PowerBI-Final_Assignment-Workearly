# PowerBI Final Assignment (Workearly)

This project is designed to simulate the data processing, analysis and visualization workflow of a Data Analyst through Power BI Desktop.

Use the provided dataset (Workearly â€“ 1-Assignment Dataset) to complete the following tasks.

Task 1: Create measures:
 
Create a measure named Sampling% using a quality data table (in all of the followings), to demonstrate from the complete task how many samples we have taken.
 
Create a measure named Defect% using defects and Samples.
 
Create also a measure named Fatal Error% using Fatal Error and Samples.
 
Finally create a measure named Quality score using the following formula: 1-Defects%. 
 
Task 2: Using the provided images, load the background- 1 and fit it properly in Power Bi.
 
Task 3: Using the card gragh, demonstrate the total task. Do the same for samples, defects and fatal error.
 
Note: On sample, use also the sampling% in other card graph demonstrating as a percentage. Do the same for the defects and the fatal error.
 
Task 4: Using the gauge chart demonstrate as a percentage the Quality Score and locate it in the appropriate field in our visualization.

Task 5: Create a scatter chart in order to demonstrate the samples vs defects combining them by EMP name. Change also the size by fatal error and in order to provide more contextual information and detail to data points on the visual, use the fatal error in play axis.
 
Task 6: You need to demonstrate the fatal errors by month using an area graph.
 
Task 7: You need to demonstrate the quality score by a supervisor, using a donut chart, and change then the label by Category, and data value.

Task 8: Using the clustered bar chart show the sampling% to the supervisor.  

Task 9:  In this task, you need to show the quality score by work location using a map chart.
 
Task 10: Rename the page as Quality Dashboard. Also, create a new workspace, change the type of the page to a tooltip and also allow the page to be used as a tooltip.
Finally, rename the page as EMP Tooltip.
 
Task 11: Create a clustered bar chart so can show the quality score by employer name (the numbers should be on percentages).

Task 12: Create a new page using the background 2 images that we have provided to you and fit it properly on the screen.

Task 13:  You must demonstrate the employee performance by the supervisor. Use all the necessary fields you think are needed.
